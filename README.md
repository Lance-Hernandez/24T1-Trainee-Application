# 24T1 DevSoc Trainee Application
## Profile Page with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

To apply for the DevSoc Training Program as a trainee, we were tasked to produce a "profile page" with the theme of 'Time'.

As this project is to act as a "profile" page, I included the following in a bento/grid style:
- Name, year and brief description
- Statistics (inc. age, etc.)
- Flags of country of birth and nationality
- Portfolio project
- Social Links
  - Discord anchor copies username to clipboard for ease of adding friend

For this project, I implemented dynamic script with JS to imbue the notion of time passing throughout the day. To do this, I added the following features:
- A live clock that matches the time of the user system
- A greeting at the top of the container that changes depending on the time ("Good morning/afternoon/evening!")
- Container background that changes depending on the time (matches with the greeting above)
  - Backgrounds from: https://www.spriters-resource.com/ds_dsi/pokemonheartgoldsoulsilver/
- Night/Dark-mode that is enabled from 7PM - 5AM

<b><i>Wish me luck!</i>  This would be an amazing opportunity to learn new skills and meet new people as I begin a new degree!</b>
